here are the bugs that need to be fixed:
make sure after resolving each bug , the previous bugs are still solved


desktop:
    all pages: reduce the heigth between the header and the first image/text to the heigth of the header
    all pages: when being at the top of a page, there should be 41 px of space above the header. when starting to scroll, the header should scroll to the top of the visible page and stay there.

mobile:
    all pages: the burger menu icon is not vertically aligned
    homepage-lightroom: the double pictures Tanzende and ohne Titel are overflowing the frame. they should have the same spaces left and right like the other pictures.
    homepage-ligthroom: I can scroll the background homepage while being in lightroom mode. that should not be possible! there shouldn't be an option to scroll top to bottom in lightroom!
    the header is not sticky but it should be! when scrolling down, the header should always stay at the top of the visible page.
    about me: the left aligned text should be vertically aligned with the left end of the big top picture
    homepage: the picture Zaghaft beginnt etwas Neues should not overlap with the description text
    exhibitions: for the second description (Ausstellung "Licht und Kunst - Kunst und Licht") add breaks here: 
        Ausstellung "Licht und Kunst - break
        Giesecke Licht + Design break
    all pages: reduce the heigth between the header and the first image/text to the heigth of the header
